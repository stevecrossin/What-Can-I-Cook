Bugs to fix:

* If ingredients selected has no recipes available, IndexOutOfBounds exception occurs - needs try/catch - Recipes.java:82, Recipes.java:87 (FIXED)
* On landscape, MainActivity buttons not constrained identically
* Ingredients are excluded based on dietary requirements, but recipes are not in standard search (Tested: Selected "lacto-veg (excludes meat, fish and eggs but not dairy), and results that needed eggs still appears"
* Ingredient suggestion suggests ingredients that are supposed to be excluded
* Recipe_results - suggestions arent perfectly constrained when clicked
