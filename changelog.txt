What's next?
+ Enable exact match recipe search

Sunday 14 April - Steve
+ Fix some string values, and some code that could cause exceptions. Adjusted recipe results layout to stretch content, added textview to enable searching for ingredients
rather than manual selection, updated CSV files to clean display, adjust other layouts. Intolerances UI issues fixed.

Monday 15 April - Trong
+ BRAVO!!! Milestone 3 reached!!! Recipe search has been fully implemented with missing ingredients mode and exact match mode!!!!
+ Switching between 2 modes by turning on/off the switch in recipe result
+ This function is carefully tested, both with SQL queries and in-app using.
+ I need holiday XD

What's next?
+ A few displaying bugs in layout that needs to be fixed.
+ Images! 
+ Improve example data.

Henry Feedback: 
+ Good to see Milestone 3 reached (and you aimed and stayed on target for milestones).
+ I need a holiday too.

Tuesday 16 April - Steve
+ Images implemented and display correctly in categories and for recipes
+ Layout fixed in recipes to allow separating of ingredients by colon separator, some bugs experienced in recipe steps, still in progress
+ I also badly need a holiday

Next steps
+ Fix layout issue with recipe steps displaying correctly
+ Allow different images to be displayed based on CSV or whatever is in storage for that category/recipe
+ Code autocomplete textbox to allow easy search of ingredients.
+ Comment code (Yes, I haven't forgotten! :-))

Sunday 21st April - Monday 22 April
+ Additional features for recipe search is implemted - Ingredient suggestion (section 3.2.9)
   - After the user performs a search for recipes, the results will be displayed as normal. Additionally, the application will in the background be aware of recipes that the user is missing ingredients for, and display a list of suggested ingredients, which if selected, will update the list of recipes to the user.
   - Already well-tested manually. The feature can be seen more obvious with better test data.
   - How it is implemented: user is suggested 3 missing ingredient for one top most recipe that they are possible to cook.
   - Once they clicked the ingredient, the recipe table will be updated. suggestion panel will also be updated with new ingredient
   - If they are missing less than 3 ingredients for the top most possibly used recipe, suggestion panel only show those ingredients (either 1 or 2). 
     Side effects: If they don't like the top most available recipe, the suggestion box still suggest ingredients for that recipe until they've clicked all. 

+ Happy Easter every one

What's next:
- Save recipe
- Share recipe

Saturday - Sunday 27/28 April - Steve
+ Images load from CSV and reference files in drawable for categories.
+ Early alpha testing was done on core functionality of the application, both on AVD and an actual phone. Bugs found mostly on layout issues and will be flagged for remediation.
+ Licenses.txt file create for app images.
+ Recipe images working! \o/
+ Recipe results - dynamic autosizing of text to fit
+ Bug fixes to buttons to suggest ingredients - there were layout problems
+ Recipe images also appearing in recipe results and not just detailed view - however may remove this later, depending on user feedback
+ Remove redundant, and old/unused code. Strip out unnecessary pseudocode.
+ AppDB updated to include pantry DAO, getter/setter methods written and basic pantry code.

What's next for Steve (this week (whatever week that is!)
+ Pantry implementation - simplex function where they are given a text box that autocompletes and they type in what they have
+ Also ability to add ingredients by text search
+ Commenting code blitz (WAY OVERDUE FOR ME, yes I know!)
+ Fix layout issues with app
+ Test logging to log scene
+ Write the app about screen.
+ Try to source some better recipe data - what we have works as proof of concept, but its honestly garbage for actual release (I don't even know what vegetable shortening is...)

Milestone 3 is well and truly complete, with Milestone 4 mostly complete from code perspective, features implemented:
o	Missing ingredient function implemented and working within app
o	Ingredient suggestion implemented and working within app

Missing features:
o	Save recipe function implemented and working within app
o	Share function implemented and working within app
o	Banner ads function implemented and working within app

Monday 29 April - Steve
* Changelog updated, task list and bugs to fix written

Monday 29th April - Trong
+ Save recipe function is implemented (See section 3.2.1)
  - In the recipe search page, every recipe row will have a "Save" button similar to a floppy disk
  - When they clicked the icon, it will become a green "Checked" icon - that's when the recipe has been saved
  - They can access their saved recipes in the "Saved Recipe"
+ Share recipe function is implemented (See section 3.2.2)
  - In the recipe detail page, there will be a "share" icon/button
  - When they clicked the icon, it will pop up a new intent, asking user which media they want to share via
  - Sharing recipe model is only TEXT-BASED, no image: recipe name, then new line, then recipe ingredients, then new line, then recipe steps.
+ Google ad function is implemented (See section 3.2.3)
  - Basically there is a little banner ad in almost every scene of the app. Except for log in and app splash scene.
  - I use the test/sample adUnitId from https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner
  - We will have our own adUnitId in the future.
+ Custom recipe has been implemented. 
   - From the Saved Recipes window, users will have an option to add their own recipe, and from there can enter in their own recipes for future reference through text input.
   - The custom recipe, however, is still saved in the same db as the imported one. The only difference is that custom recipe has the field is_customed set to true.
+ Bugs in recipe search where no ingredients selected was fixed. Was caused by a log line for debugging purpose.

What's next?
+ Bug fixes
+ Comment code
+ Improve "Saved recipe" page by adding an edit function and a delete function.

Monday/Tues 29 April - Steve
+ Updated changelog to format better
+ Reviewed implemented code
+ Worked on pantry in private branch, and autocomplete
+ Nix ad banner from categories and ingredients picker, makes layout too small
+ Sort ingredients CSV alphabetically
+ Add some common ingredients to CSV that were missing (SALT AND OIL IS NOW THERE)
+ Made some updates to CSV files, still in progress

What's next

* Finalise pantry and autocomplete text box
* Write about page for app
* Ensure logs are posted to log scene
* Write user stories (as a user, I want to be able to do XYZ) and begin alpha testing
* Add fructose intolerance, change "Choose a cuisine" to more suitable title (Had a friend do some testing and give feedback)
* Vlookup ingredients and recipes to better match and ensure all ingredients in recipes exist in ingredients DB - data is crap
* Debugging
* Commenting code
* Publish app for beta testing once all above complete, send out links to people to test

Notes: Milestone 4 is nearly complete and will be completed on schedule or earlier. Most of the time after this will be dedicated to testing and bugfixes, trying to break the app every way possible to ensure everything functions correctly.

Tuesday/Wed 30 April - 1 May - Steve
* Tons of data matching work on recipes/ingredients
* Private branch almost complete to implement pantry, still undergoing final testing and will be merged today.

What's next
* Autocomplete search for ingredients
* Google Sign in
* Commenting
* Bugfixes etc

Thursday/Friday 2-3 May - Steve
* Pantry feature implemented and tested
* Autocomplete search of ingredients in ingredient search implemented and tested
* Ability to delete ingredients selected rather than only clear ingredients implemented and tested
* Constraints in pantry and recipe results fixed, bugs have been noted in bug fix to remediate
* Squashing bugs

Progress on Milestones:

Milestone 4 is complete except Google Sign In, which is a nice to have feature at this stage. Testing as part of Milestone 5 is also underway, and has been done on the app but will continue.

What's next
* Tidy code - it's a mess, but it works
* Comment all code, remove redundant junk
* Write about page and licenses
* Implement logs
* Continue work on CSV data to clean.
* Google Sign In by this weekend
* I am tired

Saturday 4th May - Trong
+ Fixed bug: Ingredients are excluded based on dietary requirements, but recipes are not in standard search (Tested: Selected "lacto-veg (excludes meat, fish and eggs but not dairy), and results that needed eggs still appears
+ Fixed bug: Ingredient suggestion suggests ingredients that are supposed to be excluded

What's next?
+ Bug fixes
+ Comment code
+ Improve "Saved recipe" page by adding an edit function and a delete function.

Sat 4 May - Steve
* Tested bugfixes for recipe exclusion. Bug still existed - caused by databases not being loaded at initialisation.

+ Relocated code - major change. All data is loaded from CSV and into DB at runtime. Researched online best way to do this, and found RxJava to be a more efficient way to do this, so wrote a class
"DbPopulatorUtil" that contains the loading of all files into CSV and into DB. Also modified the splash screen code, so this will be executed
at loading of the application as an async task with multiple cases for file loading, with the LoginActivity starting once load is complete.
+ Discovered a flaw in recipe data - recipe steps dont match recipe. Already found source of problem, easy fix, re-parsing "recipe steps" from raw data - will be resolved by COB Saturday

To do:
+ Alter recipe viewholder to display missing ingredients to end user, rather than just on the recipe details page, similar to original UI design
+ Alter missingingredients layout to have missing suggestions as just clickable text rather than buttons, similar to UI design.
+ Take a look at raw recipe data, identified how raw data is separated, try process to parse so more recipes can exist in the app
+ Try Google Single Sign In
+ Comment code
+ Other tasks as per todo list.


With this update, most major bugs detected have been squashed.

Monday/Tuesday 6/7 May - Steve
* Updates to CSV files to better match data and remediate recipe problems
