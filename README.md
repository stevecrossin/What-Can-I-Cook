# What Can I Cook - Android Application

This is a working directory for an Android application that will form the substance for my assignment 
a Deakin University subject - SIT305. The application is coded in Java.

The purpose of the application will be to provide the end user with recipes that they can cook, by selecting
from a list of ingredients that they already have at home in their pantry. It will cater to a variety of different
cuisines and dietary requirements.

This information will shortly be fleshed out. It will be completed in milestones weekly. Updates on the functionality
of this application will be provided periodically, including in the changelog.txt files
