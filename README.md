# What Can I Cook - Android Application

This is a working directory for an Android application that will form the substance for our assignment
a Deakin University subject - SIT305. The application is coded in Java.

Project by Steve Crossin: SID217109001 and Trong Hieu Lam: SID218738651

The purpose of the application will be to provide the end user with recipes that they can cook, by selecting
from a list of ingredients that they already have at home in their pantry. It will cater to a variety of different
cuisines and dietary requirements.

At the present time, the following features are currently functional in the application

* The application loads, a splash screen is presented and exits to the main menu which presents dish types to cook.
* Selecting a dish will navigate to an ingredients page, which loads both categories and ingredients that are loaded from CSV files. Awareness of cuisine type is also present based on user input.
* Core user interface has been built and views tested for different devices. Log activity, intolerance activity has been created. CSV files for recipes, ingredients and intolerances
is loaded into the database. Recipe results back end coding is partially complete.
* All database tables have been coded and most core functionality is written. saved recipes activity exists but no functionality exists
* Clearing of ingredients selected implementing and working
* Login activity is working, all database functions for login are functioning too

Milestone 2 is complete, with Milestone 3 almost complete. Code is being written to save intolerances to a users settings, and algorithms are being written to match ingredients selected with recipes to provide appropriate matches.

Login screen working, saving and loading of dietary preferences for individual users working correctly. Speed a little slow and needs optimising.
