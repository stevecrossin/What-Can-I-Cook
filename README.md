# What Can I Cook - Android Application

This is a working directory for an Android application that will form the substance for my assignment 
a Deakin University subject - SIT305. The application is coded in Java.

The purpose of the application will be to provide the end user with recipes that they can cook, by selecting
from a list of ingredients that they already have at home in their pantry. It will cater to a variety of different
cuisines and dietary requirements.

At the present time, the following features are currently functional in the application

* The application loads, a splash screen is presented and exits to the main menu which presents dish types to cook.
* Selecting a dish will navigate to an empty ingredients page, which has awareness of what dish was clicked e.g "What's for Dinner"
* Core user interface has been built and views tested for different devices. Log activity, saved recipes activity exists but no functionality only some layouuts.

At present, apart from passing basic data from the main menu to the ingredients activity, there is no code functionality.

The creation of database tables is underway, which will load from 3 CSV files:

Recipes.csv - will contain recipes that the applicaiton will present to the user, if they have available ingredients to cook it.
Ingredients.csv - complete - contains nearly 500 ingredients to select from
Intolerances.csv - complete - contains a variety of dietary preferences and intolerances. If the end user selects one of these intolerances, the application will remove the ability to select these
ingredients in the ingredients picker.

The changelog.txt file has more information on daily progress on this project.
