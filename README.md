# What Can I Cook - Android Application #

This is a working directory for an Android application, coded in Java. Project by Steve Crossin: SID217109001 and Trong Hieu Lam: SID218738651

The purpose of the application is to provide the end user with recipes that they can cook, by selecting
from a list of ingredients that they already have at home in their pantry. It will cater to a variety of different
dishes and dietary requirements, and also allows the end user to save recipes, add their own custom recipes, share recipes with other people and keep note of ingredients they have at home.

All features have been fully implemented and an overview of the progress it took to get the application from start to completion can be found in the changelog.txt file.

###
* The GitHub link for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/stevecrossin/What-Can-I-Cook)
* The application has also been published to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stevecrossin.whatcanicook)
* A [basic website](https://what-can-i-cook.flycricket.io) has also been created for the application here, to attract new users: 

## Getting Started ##

As this is an Android application, it can be run two different ways.

The GitHub repo can be cloned or downloaded in a ZIP format from GitHub and compiled in Android Studio and then run on an emulator, or a physical device.

You can do so by performing this operation.
```
$ git://github.com/stevecrossin/What-Can-I-Cook.git
```
Alternatively, the application can be run directly onto a physical device by transferring the app-release.apk onto the device, which is found in the /app/release folder.

Lastly, you can download the latest release of the application from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stevecrossin.whatcanicook)
