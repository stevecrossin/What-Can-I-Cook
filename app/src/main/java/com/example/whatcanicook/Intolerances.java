    2. Query the savedintolerances column in the Users database for the current user. It will parse out multiple intolerances that are inside quotes and brackets, with the comma between
    each intolerance separating them.
    3. It will then mark the relevant intolerance as active in the intolerance database, ands also update the UI of the activity to mark the selected intolerances as active.
